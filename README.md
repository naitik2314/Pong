## About

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle graphics library and OOP. Pong is a two-player arcade game where each player controls a paddle by moving it vertically across the screen's left or right side. Players use their paddles to strike the ball back and forth, with the goal of scoring points by making the ball pass their opponent's paddle.

## Features

- Classic Pong gameplay
- Two-player mode
- Adjustable score limit for winning the game
- Customizable player names.
- Basic collision detection and scoring
