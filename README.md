## About

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle graphics library. Pong is a two-player arcade game where each player controls a paddle by moving it vertically across the screen's left or right side. Players use their paddles to strike the ball back and forth, with the goal of scoring points by making the ball pass their opponent's paddle.

## Demo

You can play the game by running the `main.py` script. Make sure you have Python and the Turtle graphics library installed.

  ```shell
